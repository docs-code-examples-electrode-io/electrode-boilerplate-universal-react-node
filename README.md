# Building large scale universal React Web Applications

Electrode was developed by Walmart Labs in 2016 as an internal rapid application development framework for Walmart. Electrode is one of the technology engines powering the <http://www.walmart.com> eCommerce website.

Electrode Web is a rapid application development framework; a full stack, end-to-end platform for developing, deploying, and maintaining JavaScript applications at Walmart.

We maintain additional code to support internal systems.
> If you are a Walmart developer, please check internal docs to get started.
